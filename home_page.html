            <p class="container">We, team Neurotics, are focused on creating a safer environment for sports and players around the world. 
                The product we have developed is what we like to call the Sensor Band. The Sensor Band is used to track brain activity during sports 
                and for coaches/trainers to recognize forces done to the band, this will be able to prevent athletes from further injury. This product 
                should be easily worn by the athlete without it directly affecting their game, while maintaining good health within all kinds of athletes.
                <br>
                The Sensor Band product is intended to lower the amount of concussion a player gets in their career. We envision this to primarily help 
                athletes at the higher level for example college and professional players. We want a product whose emphasis is on slowing down the amount 
                of concussions, so a player does not get CTE which leads to many other mental health illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and mood swings.

                    <li>Athlete Statistics-Users can request a list of statistics for a specific athlete. Statistics may include: 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Date and time of last impact </li>

                    <li>Alert Notifications_System shall send notifications of the force of each impact accompanied by the player name/jersey number who received that impact to the user (based on readings from sensors in the headband, which are then sent to the system device thingy)
