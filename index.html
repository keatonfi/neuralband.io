       <font size="4"> <p style="text-align:center ;">We, team Neurotics, are focused on creating a safer environment for sports and players around the world.<br> The product we have developed is what we like to call the Sensor Band.
        The Sensor Band is used to track<br> brain activity during sports and for coaches/trainers to recognize forces done to the band, this will be able <br>to prevent athletes from further injury.
          This product should be easily worn by the athlete without it directly<br> affecting their game, while maintaining good health within all kinds of athletes.
The Sensor Band product<br> is intended to lower the amount of concussion 
a player gets in their career. We envision this to primarily<br> help athletes 
at the higher level for example college and professional players.
We want a product whose<br> emphasis is on slowing down the amount of concussions, 
so a player does not get CTE which leads to<br> many other mental health illnesses such as depression, 
anxiety, and mood swings.</p></font>
